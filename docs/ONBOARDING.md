## ⏳ Time Line ⏳

- **30 Days** Learn all about the codebase and product
- **3 Months** Add and Upgrade features
- **6 Months** contribute to the future of the product
- **1 Year** Onboard new Devs

## ✨ Work Flow Steps ✨

### Clone repo

Open project in Github desktop or fork/clone repo. Then `yarn` and `yarn start` to start localhost

### Branches

All work is done in feature branches, branched from master and after a verified PR, merged back to master

### Test

Write test code if possible, make sure to run testing locally. Since most components use snapshot testing, run `yarn test` and click `u` to update snapshots if needed.

Test run automatically before every push

### Commits

Follow this [naming convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to write your commits, commit as much as possible

### Possible Commit Types

- `chore`: Change build process, tooling or dependencies.
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- `feat`: Adds a new feature.
- `fix`: Solves a bug.
- `docs`: Adds or alters documentation.
- `style`: Improves formatting, white-space.
- `refactor`: Rewrites code without feature, performance or bug changes.
- `perf`: Improves performance.
- `test`: Adds or modifies tests.
- `revert`: Changes that reverting other changes

### Lint & Format

Run `yarn post-commit` after commits to lint, format and test your code, without the push will fail

ESlint and Prettier both run automatically with each commit

### PR

Creating a PR to merge to Master triggers CircleCi to run a build, test, lint the code in the PR to make sure it's good to go!! Use Github Desktop and Gitlense VS code extension

### Release

Merge PR to Release branch to trigger a release, then CircleCi will deploy the code to firebase hosting

## ✨ Folder structure ✨

### Containers

1. **Containers** are pages and represent features in the app. Each container can have components specific to it and can not be shared with other components

2. **Data Flow** generally its a good idea to initiate an async call to the db and while waiting of the data start rendering the UI. This can be done by making the parent container fetch data from firebase using a React hook. Child components will most likely be rendering the layout of page. Example `Course` container

3. **Page Layout** holds layout styling and renders rest of components for the page

```
Container (data fetch)> PageComponent (layout & logic) > ChildComponents (dummy components)

```

### Components

1. **Library** Components specific to MoSkool UI Elements and they are all dumb components

2. **Shared** Components that share logic and functionality with the rest of the components and containers

### Constants

**Routes** and **Roles** can be found here
Example usage:

```
import * as ROUTES from "constants/routes";
import * as ROLES from "constants/roles";
```

### Hooks

Shared React hooks for fetching data from db

### Mocks

Mock data for testing and data simulation in components

### Helpers

Shared functionality

## ✨Styling Material-UI ✨

1. Styling is done through Material-UI, by using their hooks or higher order components by using `css-in-js`
2. **Material-UI Hooks** allows more control over styling by dynamically changing style through props

```
//index.js

import makeStyles from "@material-ui/core/styles/makeStyles";
import createStyles from "@material-ui/core/styles/createStyles";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) =>
    createStyles({
      myClass: {
        //css-in-js
        ...
      },
    })
  );

  const classes = useStyles();
  return (
    ...
        <h1 className="classes.myClass"></h1>
    ...
  );
};
```

3. **Material-UI HOC** less control but can render the component with styling hooks once the component is mounted

```
// styles.js

const styles = (theme) => ({
  myClass: {
      //css-in-js
      ...
  }
});

export default styles;
```

```
// index.js

import withStyles from "@material-ui/core/styles/withStyles";
import styles from "./styles";

const MyComponent = ({ classes }) => {
...
<h1 className="classes.myClass'></h1>
...

export default withStyles(styles)(MyComponent);
```

4. **Theme** there is a theme file in `App/theme.js` containing all styling and can be used with material HOC/hooks to style components

## ✨Material-UI Grid ✨

```
// Container and spacing between elements
<Grid container spacing={4}>
    // Each item in grid based on 12 grid
     <Grid item xs={2} sm={2} md={2} lg={2}>
        ...
    </Grid>
     <Grid item xs={2} sm={2} md={2} lg={2}>
        ...
    </Grid>
</Grid>

```

## ✨Material-UI Typography ✨

```
<Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
    Hello React!
</Typography>

```

## ✨Material-UI Animation ✨

1. Fade, Grow, Zoom, and Slide. Returns children when `in` prop is true

```
<Fade timeout={{ enter: 800, exit: 800 }} in={true} mountOnEnter unmountOnExit>
    ...
</Fade>

```
